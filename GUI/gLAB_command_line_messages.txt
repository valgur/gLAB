  MESSAGES FORMAT
    INFO
        INFO messages are shown at several points in the program and provide information on the
          program configuration, events and problems it may encounter, which are:

             At the start of the file, showing information about gLAB configuration.
             An inconsistent clock update on the receiver.
             A data gap in the RINEX observation file.
             A change in the a priori receiver coordinates (only when receiver coordinates are computed by gLAB).
             The new position to be used from the reference position file (only when a reference file is provided).
             No solution was computed, along with the reason for not being able to compute the
                solution (not enough satellites available, singular geometry matrix or DOP too high).
             In SBAS processing, the elevation of each GEO and the one selected (if GEO selection with highest
                elevation is enabled).
             In SBAS processing, a GEO or mode switch.
             In SBAS processing, if option '-mode:selectbestgeo' is enabled, in each epoch, for each GEO which a
               solution can be computed, the GEO PRN, its protection levels and a message if the GEO was selected is
               printed. The selected GEO will be always the last one.
             In DGNSS processing, a switch from DGNSS to SPP solution mode.
             In DGNSS processing, a data gap in the reference station RINEX observation file.

        The satellite coordinates (fields 11-16) are given in the transmission epoch if the model of the
          signal transmission time is enabled (if it is disabled, they are given in the reception
          time). The coordinates are relative to the antenna phase centre or satellite mass centre,
          depending on the products input:
            * Broadcast: Antenna Phase Centre
            * Precise: Satellite Mass Centre
        Field 9 is the direct measurement (as in the RINEX file), but scaled to metres for carrier phase
          measurements. Field 10 is the model computed for this measurement. Field 10 is the direct sum
          of fields 17 to 28.
        When the '*' appears in field 1, it is due to smoothed code of the satellite has not reached steady-state, a SBAS processing mode switch
          or SBAS GEO switch. When a mode or GEO switch occurs, the SBAS corrections have to be computed again.
        The SNR value in field 31 may be any of these values (in this order): the "S" measurement in the
          observation file, or if it is not present, it will be the SNR flag in the current measurement.
          If no SNR is available, 999 will be printed in this field.

        NOTES:
          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight)
            are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the summary and
            the Stanford-ESA computation will be skipped. This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If backwards processing is active, epochs missing and data gaps will only be counted during the forward processing.
          If receiver position is not fixed or provided by a reference file, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates.
          If receiver position is not fixed, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.
          Stanford-ESA messages will not appear if Stanford-ESA computation has not been enabled.
          HDOP, PDOP and GDOP threshold messages will not appear if HDOP, PDOP or GDOP thresholds have not been enabled respectively.
          The lines referring to a reference file will only appear if a user sets a reference file. If user sets the reference file just for comparing
            the solution, the line "Total epochs omitted in ..." will appear. Otherwise, if the reference file was set to be used as the a priori
            position for the modelling computation, the line "Total epochs skipped due to no position from reference file ..." will appear.

        NOTES:
          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight
          	are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the SBAS summary and
          	the Stanford-ESA computation will be skipped. This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If receiver position is not fixed or provided by a reference file, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          The last line of the SBAS summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates.
          If receiver position is not fixed, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.
          The fields at the end of the last line 'HWIR_ESA', 'VWIR_ESA', 'MIs_ESA', 'Hor_MIs_ESA' and 'Ver_MIs_ESA' correspond to the values computed in Stanford-ESA.
            These fields will appear even if Stanford-ESA has not been enabled, but with a value of 0 (so its column number is fixed).
          Stanford-ESA messages will not appear if Stanford-ESA computation has not been enabled.
          HDOP, PDOP and GDOP threshold messages will not appear if HDOP, PDOP or GDOP thresholds have not been enabled respectively.
          Number of epochs with NPA epoch message will not appear if mode switching has not been enabled.

          If user forced NPA processing through parameters, then all values in SBAS summary will be referred to NPA mode.
          The lines referring to a reference file will only appear if a user sets a reference file. If user sets the reference file just for comparing
            the solution, the line "Total epochs omitted in ..." will appear. Otherwise, if the reference file was set to be used as the a priori
            position for the modelling computation, the line "Total epochs skipped due to no position from reference file ..." will appear.

    SATDIFF [orbit and clock comparison]
        Satellite difference message for products comparison mode. This message shows the difference between
        both orbit and clocks for two different OC products fonts for a specific time. It is shown each time step.
        The SISRE fields are the Signal-in-Space Range Error, it is a measure of how the error impact a general
        receiver found in the Earth's surface. It is computed as:
            SISRE = sqrt((radDiff-clkDiff)^2 + 1/49*(ctDiff^2 + atDiff^2))
        Being:
            radDiff, the difference of satellite positions in the radial component
            clkDiff, the difference of satellite clock offsets
            ctDiff, the difference of satellite positions in the cross-track component

    SATSTATTOT [orbit and clock comparison]

        Difference summary message for products comparison mode. This message shows the statistics of the
        differences between orbit and clocks for two different OC products fonts. It is shown after all the
        comparisons are done, and presents a summary for all of them.
        All time tags are in GPS time.

    SATPVT [show product mode]
        Satellite data messages for show product mode. This message show the PVT data for a specific time
        and satellite. All time tags are in GPS time.
        Coordinates are in WGS84 system except for BeiDou with broadcast orbits, which are in CGCS2000 system.
        CGCS2000 system is aligned to WGS84 to a few centimetres, therefore, it is assumed that CGCS2000=WGS84.
        Field 1:      'SATPVT'
        Field 2:      Year
        Field 3:      Doy
        Field 4:      Seconds of day
        Field 5:      GNSS System (GPS, GAL, GLO, GEO or BDS)
        Field 6:      PRN satellite identifier
        Field 7:      Satellite X position [m]
        Field 8:      Satellite Y position [m]
        Field 9:      Satellite Z position [m]
        Field 10:     Satellite X velocity [m/s]
